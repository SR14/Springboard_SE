    <h1>Conceptual Questions: Box Model</h1>

    <ul>
        
        <li>What is the box model?</li>
        <p>The box model defines the spacing of each piece of content; it includes the sizing of the content, padding, border and margin.</p>

        <li>What is the difference between margin and padding?</li>
        <p>Padding defines the space between the content box and the border box. On the other hand, margin defines the space between the border and other content. </p>

        <li>What is collapsing margin?</li>
        <p>Collapsing margin is when two margins get combined into one to preserve uniformity. If looked at individually, both content borders will have the margin specified, but the total margin will be that of only the largest margin.</p>
        
        <li>What is the purpose of the <b>box-sizing</b> CSS property?</li>
        <p>Box sizing lets you define whether the size set for the element describes only the content box or everything including the border.</p>

        <li>What does the <b>outline</b> property do?</li>
        <p>The outline property lets you create a outline <emp>outside</emp> of the border lines. This way the outline does not take up the content's space inside of the border. </p>

        <li>How do you add a background image in CSS?</li>
        <p>You add a background image by using the property <b>background-image: url("");</b> and setting the value to the location of the image desired.</p>

        <li>Given a <b>div</b> with a width of 200px, margin of 20px and padding of 20px, what is the calculated width by the browser?</li>
        <p>Since margin is not factored into the width calculation of an element, only the padding will be considered. The 200px element will get padding of 20px on the left and 20px on the right for a total width of 240px.</p>

        <li>Given a <b>div</b> with a height of 100px, border of 10px and padding of 20px, what is the calculated height by the browser?</li>
        <p>Margin is not factored in to the dimensions of an element but the border is. Therefore, the total height of the div element will be 100px + 20px(padding top) + 20px(padding bottom) + 10px(border top) + 10px(border bottom), for a total height of 160px.</p>

        <li>What does <b>margin:auto</b> do?</li>
        <p>The property:value <b>margin:auto</b> can be used to center an element along the width of a page, and it dynamically centers the element as the browser window is shrunk or enlarged.</p>
    </ul>
