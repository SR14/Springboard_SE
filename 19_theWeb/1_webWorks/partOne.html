        <h2>Part One: Solidify Terminology</h2>
        <p><b>What is HTTP?</b> HTTP is a type of communication convention between computers.</p>
        <p><b>What is a URL?</b> URLS contain information that is broken up and used to retrieve information from servers.</p>
        <p><b>What is DNS?</b> Naming system to turn hostnames into IP Adresses.</p>
        <p><b>What is a query string</b> Additional information passed on during a request to specify parameters within the requested page.</p>
        <p><b>What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?</b> GET and POST are two types of HTTP verbs/methods. The GET verb does not change any of the data at the server; examples include links. The POST verb changes the data at the server; examples include sending an email.</p>
        <p><b>What is an HTTP request?</b> An HTTP request specifices the place where you want to get your information from.</p>
        <p><b>What is an HTTP response?</b> An HTTP response returns the information found at the location the HTTP request indicated.</p>
        <p><b>What is an HTTP header? Examples fo request and response headers.</b> An HTTP header contains specific information about the request and response currently being made. A common header for a request is the Host: header which indicates the hostname requested. A common response header is Content-Type: which indicates the type of content the response will return. </p>
        <p><b>What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?</b> First the URL will get broken down into its main components, which are the protocol (in this case HTTP), hostname (somesite.com), port (default 80), resources (some/page.html), and query (no additional parameters passed in this case). After the URL gets broken down the components get sent to a server which may or may not interact with other servers to finally respond with the content found at the URL sepcified. </p>
