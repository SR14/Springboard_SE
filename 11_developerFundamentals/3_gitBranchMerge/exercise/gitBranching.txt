1. What git command creates a branch?
git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME

2. What is the difference between a fast-forward and recursive merge?
A fast-forward merge does not create a new merge commit, since there was no additional commits on the master branch. A recursive commit creates a new merge commit, since there has been intermediary commits along the way in both the created branch and the master branch.

3. What git command changes to another branch?
git checkout BRANCH_NAME	

4. What git command deletes a branch?
git branch -d BRANCH_NAME

5. How do merge conflicts happen?
When the same line on the same file is modified on two branches. During the merging process of both branches, Git will ask which one of the two or what alternative final commit you would like to make.
