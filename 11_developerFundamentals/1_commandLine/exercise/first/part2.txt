I have used the -a flag in combination with the ls command to show me all the files and folders within a directory, including the hidden files. I have used the combination of the -r and -f flags with rm to remove all the files inside of the folder as well as the folder; the -r flag deletes everything inside of the folder and the -f flag makes it so it won't ask for confirmation.
